1. As a user, I want my score displayed at game over, so that I know how well I did.
2. As a user, I want to progress through the level only when the correct characters have been typed,
so that I know Iâ€™m practicing good typing skills.
3. As a computer science student, I want an error message if the game crashes, so that I know that
the developers have handled exceptions well.
